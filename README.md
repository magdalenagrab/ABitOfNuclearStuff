# Cs-137 Gamma Spectrum Analysis (Python & C++)

This repository demonstrates a Cs-137 gamma spectrum simulation and comparison with detector data.

## Overview

- **Python**: simulates the Cs-137 spectrum and plots it directly as a PNG file.  
- **C++**: generates the same simulated spectrum as CSV for comparison or high-performance simulations.  

## Cs-137 Info

Cesium-137 is a radioactive isotope commonly used for detector calibration, industrial gauges, medical applications, and environmental monitoring. It emits gamma radiation at 662 keV during its decay.
