# 📘 Radioactive Decay Simulator (Python Project)

## 🔬 Overview

This project is a modular, extensible Python toolkit for simulating radioactive decay of isotopes.  
It includes:

- a clean object-oriented model (**Isotope class**),
- a mini isotope database (**isotopes_data.py**),
- a numerical decay engine using **numpy** (**decay_sim.py**),
- and a fully functional command-line interface (**cli.py**) with plotting via **matplotlib**.

The goal is to provide a simple but powerful foundation for nuclear-related simulations — useful for educational purposes, engineering tasks, radiation safety, and scientific demonstrations.

## 🧪 Why radioactive decay?

Radioactive decay is one of the most fundamental processes in nuclear engineering, radiation protection, medical physics, and environmental studies.  
Simulating decay helps understand:

- long-term activity of waste,
- radiation exposure from isotopes,
- environmental behavior of radionuclides,
- isotope selection in industrial applications,
- decay chains and equilibrium dynamics.

## 🧬 Example: Potassium-40 (K-40)

To demonstrate the tool, we use **Potassium-40**, one of the most interesting naturally occurring radioactive isotopes.

**Why K-40?**

- It has an extremely long half-life: ~1.25 billion years.
- It occurs naturally in bananas, potatoes, cocoa, and many other potassium-rich foods.
- Every human body contains ~140g of potassium → which means we all carry radioactive K-40 inside us.
- A human body emits about 4,000 radiation decays per second (4 kBq) purely from K-40 — and this is perfectly natural and harmless.

Using K-40 as the demo isotope highlights how radioactive decay is not only a reactor or lab process — it's part of everyday life.
